# Welcome to my html-CSS project
### My aim in this basic level project was to create a concrete work with the basic HTML features and my CSS knowledge.

Here you can see my draft-page which it's running on my local host:

As in my previous repo, I first opened my logo_wrapper, menu_container and profile_container containers in my navbar_container. Then I compiled all of them except the logo in a flex structure and made them sticky:

Then, unlike the previous ones, I used webkit tools to give a different font to the text and logo on my page:

Then I simply filled my sidebar_container and made it sticky in the column flex structure.

After these steps, I placed the image of the featured content in the background under the featured_content container and placed a description called featured_description and featured_buttons buttons with a flex structure:

(Not functional) I put a filtering where you select the category with the help of option-tag.

Then I opened three mothers, popular, hot and new, to give containers to each of them. Then I gave movie_list_wrapper to each of them and got 3 lists in total 3 containers. Then I set up the basic structure by giving a flex structure to these 3 structures named movie_list. Then you can find the added details in the style.css file. In this way, I have established the basic flex, wrapper and container logic. The added day-night mode and arrows at the end of the list are not functional:
